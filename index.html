		<h3>Welcome to our online map viewer! Here you will find interacting maps of
		pervious scans performed by BEAM.

		<h4>Platforms</h4>
		<h3>
		<br><br>
		We have three scanning platforms:
		<br><br>
		</h3>

		<div id="results_container">
			<div id="ig_container">
				<h3><strong>1. Inspector Gadget (IG) :</strong> this is our continuous scanning platform.
						It continously performs localization and mapping as it drives around for
					  fastest mapping results and best area coverage. This product is still in
						early stages of development.
				</h3>
				<br><br>

			</div>
			<div id="roben_container">
				<h3><strong>2. Robot Eng (RobEn) :</strong> this is our stop-and-go scanning solution. This robot
						must stop to take scans (<10s/scan). This scanner is very rapid compared to
						the Faro but not as quick as IG. The mapping and full colourization of the
						map is done automatically within minutes of taking the scan. This product is
						 in its final stages of development.
				</h3>
				<br><br>

			</div>
			<div id="faro_container">
				<h3><strong>3. Faro Focus :</strong> We also own a more traditional tripod based laser scanner
				(often referred to as Terrestrial Laser Scanners). This is the current
				go-to solution for most land-based laser scanning. These scans are very time
				consuming and manual data-processing is required after collecting the
				scans to generate the final maps.

		<h4>Mapping with the Autonomoose</h4>

		<h3>
		<br><br>
		We also have some maps generated using data from the University of Waterloo's
		autonomous vehicle platform, the Autonomoose. This work was done in
		collaboration with the Waterloo Autonomous Vehicles (WAVE) lab. Specifically,
		we lead research on filtering snowfall from Lidar scans for autonomous vehicles.
		We developped a custom de-noising filter to remove snow in real-time without
		removing important environmental features. This work was published and presented
		at the Computer and Robot Vision (CRV) conference in 2018 (see paper here).
